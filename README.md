Our project is based on the comfort of travellers and the non-residents of a city or a locality. It focuses on the problem of root mapping with travellers and avoiding accidents caused due to drink and drive .We will make a tracker that will display the roots of the bus to the travellers and our website will help them to  get the location of our blogger that will be thorough with all the destinations of the locality and will give them the insight about the whole locality and also about the famous places of that locality. They can also see  the famous places of that locality on our website. They can also overcome with the confusion of wrong names in google maps as they are now guided by our blogger about the local and the name given on google maps. The second part of our project is the DND EVALUATOR which is very useful to avoid accidents. It is caliberated with sufficient amount of alcohol and also connected with the relay motor so that as soon as the sufficient amount of alcohol is detected from the driverâ€™s breath, The engine will be ceased as this setup is installed on the steering and this information would directly go to the local traffic police or the nearest police station so that the driver is given a proper lesson about DRINKING and DRIVING and also about risking a lot of lives while doing this.
